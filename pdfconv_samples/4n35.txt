 Notes\(1\)Tamb = 25 ?C, unless otherwise specified.Stresses in excess of the absolute maximum ratings can cause permanent damage to the device. Functional operation of the device is notimplied at these or any other conditions in excess of those given in the operational sections of this document. Exposure to absolutemaximum ratings for extended periods of the time can adversely affect reliability.\(2\)Refer to wave profile for soldering condditions for through hole devices \(DIP\).Notes\(1\)Tamb = 25 ?C, unless otherwise specified.Minimum and maximum values are testing requirements. Typical values are characteristics of the device and are the result of engineeringevaluation.
