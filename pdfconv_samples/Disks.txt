OPL & DISKS1USING DISKS IN OPL\316On the Series 5, memory disks in the D: drive may be used in the same way as the internal memory byspecifying D: where you would usually specify C:.\314On the Series 3c, Solid State Disks \(SSDs\), which are explained in detail in the User guide, may be used.SienaOn the Siena, there is no support for using disks.There are two main reasons for using disks:\267To provide more room for storing data.\267To make backup copies of important information, in case you accidentally change or delete it \(or even loseyour Psion\).The discussion below explains the use of SSDs for OPL on the Series 3c.\314 TYPES OF SOLID STATE DISKThere are two types - Ram SSDs and Flash SSDs. They fit into the SSD drives marked A and B, at either side ofthe Series 3c.\267Flash SSDs are for storing or backing up information which is infrequently changed. This includes finishedOPL programs.\267Ram SSDs are for storing or backing up information which changes frequently. This includes OPL pro-grams you are still writing or testing.You can, though, save programs and data files to either kind of SSD, as you see fit.\314 HOW TO PUT PROGRAMS ON AN SSDTo create a new OPL module on an SSD, use the \221New file\222 option in the System screen as before, but set theDisk line of the dialog to A or B as required.To copy an OPL module on to an SSD, move onto the module name where it is listed under the Program icon,and use the \221Copy file\222 option on the \221File\222 menu. Set the \221To file: Disk\222 line to A or B. If you want this copy tohave a different name to the original, type the name to use, on the \221To file: Name\222 line. The new copy willappear in the list under the Program icon, but with [A] or [B] after its name.To copy the translated version of an OPL module, move onto the name in the list under the RunOpl icon \(to theright of the Program icon\), then proceed as before.\314 SSDS FROM INSIDE OPLYour OPL programs can create or use data files on SSDs. To do so, begin the name of the data file with A: orB: - for example:CREATE \223B:JKQ\224,A,X1$,X2$tries to create a data file JKQ on an SSD in B, whileDELETE \223A:X300\224tries to delete a data file X300 on an SSD in A.
OPL
OPL & DISKS2Don\22t confuse the drive names A and B with the logical names A, B, C and D. Logical names are unaffected bywhich drive a data file is on.The internal memory can be referred to as M:, if required. For example:PROC delx300:LOCAL a$\(3\),c%a$=\223MAB\224 :c%=1REM default to \223Internal\224dINIT \223Delete X300 data file\224dCHOICE c%,\224Disk:\224,\224Internal,A,B\224IF DIALOGREM returns 0 if cancelledDELETE MID$\(A$,c%,1\)+\224:X300\224ENDIFENDPIn this example, MID$\(A$,c%,1\) gives \223M\224, \223A\224 or \223B\224, according to the choice made in the dialog. This isadded on the front of \223:X300\224 to give the name of the file to delete - \223M:X300\224, \223A:X300\224 or \223B:X300\224.When using data files with SSDs, follow the same guidelines as with OPL programs - Flash SSDs are for one-offor \223finished\224 information, while Ram SSDs are for information which is still being changed.DIRECTORIES AND DOS STRUCTUREThe internal memory, memory disks and SSDs use a DOS-compatible directory structure, the same as that usedby disks on PCs.
